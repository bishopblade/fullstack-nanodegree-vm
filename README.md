# Relational Database Tournament Schema

Tournament results schema for Full Stack course.

## Running
A database named tournament must first be created with PostgreSQL. `tournament.sql` then must be run on the database.

After the database is setup, functions are provided in the `tournament` module to store and retrieve match results and
pairings for a Swiss-style tournament.
